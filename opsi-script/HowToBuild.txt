The opsi-winst / opsi-script has to be compiled by Lazarus/Freepascal

Checkout the complete lazarus repository from git.

For Standard opsi-winst / opsi-script on Windows, use
Lazarus 2.0.4 32-Bit Version (and the x86_64 crosscompiler) from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/Lazarus%20Windows%2032%20bits/Lazarus%202.0.4/
(lazarus-2.0.4-fpc-3.0.4-win32.exe  +  lazarus-2.0.4-fpc-3.0.4-cross-x86_64-win64-win32.exe)

The project files are lazarus/opsi-script/*.lpi

* project file for Windows is winst.lpi     (not (!) winst64.lpi
* project files under Linux are
  * opsiscript.lpi
  * opsiscriptnogui.lpi
  ... which may be compiled with 32bit or 64 bit Lazrus
